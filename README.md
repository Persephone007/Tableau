Citibike Analysis


Annual verse short duration subscribers:

- When analyzing user type (annual subscribers verse passes) the prodominant amount of users are annual subscribers, however, pass carriers 
use the bikes for a much longer duration between uses.  I believe that this could be due to the fact that people who buy short term passes
tend to be tourists using the bike for recreation while annual subscribers likley use the bike to travel back and forth to work. This could certainly account for the 
inverse correlation between there two data points. 

--Which Station is used shows very little variance in the percentaage of annual subscribers verse short term pass holders.


Gender: 

--Male annual subscribers outnumber females by almost 3:1. Males also outnumber female shortterm subscribers by about 2:1.

--Gender use by station shows an outlier at union street with an almost equal percent of males and females using that station. As further analysis I isolated that station and 
overlayed the 2018 census data showing the male to female ratio for that staion. The staion itself is in a female dense area and borders 
an area that is even more dense. Further research is needed to see what is causing this disproportion in males to females in that area.

--Females born between 1990 and 1999 are showing to use bikes at a ~5% higher rate than those born in all the other years between 1950
and 2002. 

--When analyzing bike users that do not report gender, The majority were born in the 1960's and 70's.
